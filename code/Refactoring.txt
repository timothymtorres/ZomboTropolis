instead of tile.outside_players/tile.inside_players do

tile.players = {}
tile.players.inside = {}
tile.players.outside = {}
OR
tile.inside = {}
tile.outside = {}

instead of 
tile.players[player] = player

do as an array
tile.players[#tile.players] = player

in all classes remove getClass(), getClassName(), getName() and put it into middleclass functions as a external lib...
