how will virsuses, healing items, cure items, and scanning items work?

FAK = 1d5 (weight shotgun?  9w)
bandage = 1d3  (weight 4w)
antidote =     (weight 3w) (high chance to heal infection)

bandage  (remaining amount)
FAK      (remaining amount)
antidote (remaining amount)
syringe

weak/mild/strong infection
1d2, 1d3, 1d4


FAKs bonus 
1d5, 2d5, 3d5
30%, 40%, 50%

bandage
1d3, 1d3+1, 1d3+2

antidote (completely cures infection)
50%, 75%, 100%

condition of equipment: better use (transmitters send longer messages, generators last longer, terminals ???)  less ap cost?

durability = # of uses, and bonuses  
USES ARE SOLID, NO CHANCE... ie. medkit (4 = 4 uses)

FAK/bandage =  (range) -1, 0, +1, +2
antidote = -10%, 0%, +10%, +20%
syringe =   -5%, 0%,  +5%, +10%


ranged = how many kills?       = 8
melee_blade = how many kills?  = 2
melee_blunt = how many kills?  = 5
